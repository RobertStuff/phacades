Psycho-Historical Analysis Correlating Arbitrary Divisions and Emerging Superpositions 

PHACADES is a meta-statistical analysis project in anthropological and historically significant observables.  

The goal of this project is to create and analyze a dataset of human behavioral and situational observables.  By superposing 
statistics of arbitraily chosen geographic divisions (in our case divided along the lines of so-called nations), a set of 
correlations can be drawn.  It is our hope that the inferences of these correlations will include new insight in the 
interplay of the observable quantitities.  

THE DATASETS 

Every dataset we include has as it's first column a "country" name, a two letter country code.  These arbitrary gegraphic 
divisions have generally been a pox on the skin of mankind and spaceship earth but they can be of use in a statistical 
correlation analysis such as this one.  For this project we limit ourselves to these arbitrary divisions - ignoring 
for example studies based on County, Continent, or province.  While this eliminates useful data such as that compiled 
by the China Project, we must choose anarrow focus to make progress.  The second  column will have a statistic quantified 
over the region.   The statistics we seach are of four types:  

1)  Health     e.g. per capital Lung Cancer, death rate, asthma rate
2)  Economic    e.g. gdp per capita, home ownership rate, income spread, debt rate
3)  Behavioral    e.g. tv use, alcohol use, dairy consumption, church attendance 
4)  Situational   e.g. average rainfall, 

THE FORMATS

When submitting a dataset, the proper format is as a .txt or .csv file.  Before or after the data itself must be included a 
description of the data - when it was taken, by whom, what url, and a general impression of the quality or notes.  Of 
great import is the unit of the number, a description of the quantity reported in the dataset.  

Datasets can be merged into a single .txt or .csv file if they are from the same source.  

Datasets can be submitted here to github as a pull request or via email to lsaul@vtscc.org.  

THE ANALYSIS 

As data come in, our correlation matrix will grow.  A relational database will be built and other higher order techniques 
of analysis embarked upon.  While correlation is a powerful indicator, understanding that correlation is not 
causation and moving forward with understanding the reason for the correlation will take careful modeling.  
The end goal is for psychohistorical models to use this dataset as a training set.
